# 🍔 ENDGAME: Burgertown RPG

A turn-based terminal RPG built in Python — where special moves come from the kitchen, not the dojo.

You’re a disgruntled food worker thrown into battle against grease-drenched enemies, bottom-tier bosses, and one final corporate nightmare: **OTHMANE**.

This isn’t schoolwork.  
This is war.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Built for the Python OOP module.  
Finished because I don’t half-cook anything.

You’ll either win, or end up cold like a forgotten drive-thru order.
